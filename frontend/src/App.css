/* It's often best practice to keep this file minimal or empty when using a utility-first
  framework like Tailwind CSS. Global styles are handled in index.css, and component-specific
  styles are handled by Tailwind classes directly in your JSX files.

  We have removed the default Vite styles for #root, .logo, and .card to prevent them
  from interfering with your custom component layouts.
